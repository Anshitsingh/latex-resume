\heading{Internships}

\textbf{Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India} \hfill May 2016 - Jul 2016\\
Natural Language Inference (NLI) using Deep Learning for NLP\\
under \emph{Prof. Ambedkar Dukkipati}

\SmallEntryGap

\indentedpar{
  Worked on NLI with the Stanford NLI dataset. Given two sentences, the task
  is to determine whether the sentences are related as an entailment, contradiction
  or are neutral. We explored a variety of methods using LSTMs, Attention
  Models, and Dependency Parses. Eventually, we came up with an hybrid model which
  is currently under preparation for submission in a reputed conference.
}

\SmallEntryGap

\textbf{University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA} \hfill May 2015 - Jul 2015\\
Computational Phenotyping using Deep Neural Networks\\
under \emph{Prof. Yan Liu}

\SmallEntryGap

\indentedpar{
  Worked with ICU time series data consisting of a multitude of medical parameters
  and used deep learning to predict health outcomes. As a regularizer we used a
  laplacian prior of label co-occurence matrix. Further, we analyzed the
  activations of the trained neural network using decision trees in order to 
  understand the features learned. We also extracted the maximally activating 
  inputs for the most decorrelated nodes and identified distinct features learned
  by the nodes. This kind of analysis is a step towards automated symptom analysis
  in patients.

\SmallEntryGap
\textbf{Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India} \hfill May 2014 - Jul 2014\\
On Farey Table and its Compression for Space Optimization with Guaranteed Error Bounds\\
under \emph{Prof. Partha Bhowmick}

\SmallEntryGap

\indentedpar{
  Studied the number theoretic properties of Farey Sequences and the
  Farey Table, and came up with a novel algorithm for the lossy compression of the 
  Farey Table. The Farey Table is an useful data-structure in digital geometry.
  It's quadratic size ($\Theta(n^2)$) prohibits its use for large dimensions. The
  compressed table has a size of ($O(n\log n)$), thus allowing table creation for
  large $n$.

\textbf{Bachelor's Thesis} \hfill Jul 2015 - Apr 2016\\
Visualization Regularizers for Neural Network based Image Recognition\\
Advisor: \emph{Prof. Pabitra Mitra}

\SmallEntryGap

\indentedpar{
    Introduced a novel regularizer for Neural Network based Image Recognition
    based on the \emph{visualizations} of the nodes of the neural
    network. We leveraged the existence of a closed algebraic form of the
    visualizations of the first layer nodes, and used it as a smoothness prior.
    We show that the regularizer is a special case of the 
    general Tikhonov regularization. Experimental results show that the 
    visualization regularizers are an improvement over standard L2 regularizers.

\SmallEntryGap

\indentedpar{
  Implemented various sampling and projection algorithms on synthetically generated
  datasets and tested on binary SVM classification. We implemented Clarkson Woodruff's
  feature sampling, Achlioptas' methods for euclidian distance preservations and 
  low rank approximations, and leverage score based sampling.
